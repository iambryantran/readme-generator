# README Generator

## Description

This repository is where I have created a README generator as an assignment for a coding bootcamp. The project is a README generator that creates a new README based off user input using Inquirer. I will likely be using this project to generate new READMEs for future projects.

## Usage

Run index.js from the command line. Inquirer will prompt you for some basic information about your project. Either type in your inputs or use the list if provided. Once you are finished, the new README file will be generated.
